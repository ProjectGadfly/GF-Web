	<h2 class="padding">Plain English Summary</h2>
	<p class="padding">To protect both you and the development team, Gadfly is designed to work with as little of your personal data as possible. At the time of this release, that data is restricted to location data only. In order to determine your political representatives, we will need your address. We will ask for this address one time on starting the app. You may provide it manually or, on supported applications and devices, you may allow us to detect it on your behalf. Then we will store in your phone, not the address, but your representatives’ information. This means that, in terms of personal data, your phone will link you to overlapping districts, but not to your house. </p>

	<p class="padding">If you move, or if your representatives change, you may “purge” your saved representatives and start over. If the app detects that a representative has likely changed, such as after an election, it may prompt you to initial a purge. </p>

	<p class="padding">In short, we don’t want your data. We just want to make it easy for you to contact people and, to do that, we need your address … but only once. </p>

	<p class="padding">If you want to be able to scan QR codes to more easily see scripts, you’ll need to let us use your camera too. If you decide to block that, though, it’s fine. Most things will still work.</p>
